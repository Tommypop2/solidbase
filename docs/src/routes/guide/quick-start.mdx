# Quick Start

SolidBase wraps your SolidStart config rather than wrapping Start itself,
so you can add SolidBase to most [existing Start projects](../add-to-existing) or create a new one.


## Create a New Project

```package-run
create solid -t with-solidbase -s
```

This automatically creates a project using the [with-solidbase](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start/tree/main/examples/with-solidbase) template.

:::note
SolidBase prerenders your pages by default,
so `data-theme` will probably be incorrect in the initial HTML.
To account for this,
a small script will automatically be injected to correct the theme before the page is rendered.
:::

## Done

Your project is now setup with the default SolidBase theme!
You can now create Markdown routes in your project that take advantage of SolidBase's [Markdown Extensions](../markdown),
and customise your project's appearance by [customising the default theme](../extending-themes#extending-the-default-theme) or [creating a new theme](../custom-themes).
